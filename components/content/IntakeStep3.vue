      <h3 id="termination-policy">Termination Policy</h3>
      <p>
        If you decide to leave the Baby Ghosts program, you're free to do so at
        any point. Please let us know in writing (via email), so we have a
        record of your decision. After we receive your message, your
        participation in the program will end immediately unless we communicate
        another end date to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Baby Ghosts team also has the right to end this agreement. If we
        decide to do this, we promise to tell you why. The reasons might be
        things like if the program is ending, if we can't provide the support we
        promised, or if there are repeated problems like missing meetings or not
        fulfilling your other obligations under this agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please understand that if this agreement ends for any reason, you'll
        need to stop using any of the Baby Ghosts program's resources, support,
        or other benefits, unless we communicate otherwise to you in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where possible, and on the rare case that we have to terminate the
        agreement, we will offer some support in terms of exiting the program
        and next steps.

      <h3 id="governing-law-and-dispute-resolution">
        Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
      </h3>
      <p>
        This agreement will be governed by the laws of Ontario. In case of any
        disputes, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the issue
        through our internal conflict resolution process. This involves engaging
        in discussions and negotiations between representatives of both parties
        to find a mutually acceptable solution. The parties may pursue other
        dispute resolution methods if the internal conflict resolution process
        does not lead to a resolution. By including this clause, we prioritize
        resolving conflicts internally before considering other options.
      </p>
      <h3 id="intellectual-property-rights">Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Baby Ghosts acknowledges that all intellectual property rights,
        including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, and patents,
        associated with the work created by the studio and its team members
        belong solely to the studio and its team members. Baby Ghosts explicitly
        states that it does not claim any ownership or license rights over the
        intellectual property created by the studio. Furthermore, Weird Ghosts
        will not receive any royalties or compensation related to the
        intellectual property created by the studio. The studio retains full
        control and ownership over its intellectual property rights, allowing
        them the freedom to monetize their work without any obligations to Weird
        Ghosts.

      <h3 id="staged-funding-disbursement">Staged funding disbursement</h3>
      <p>
        This section outlines the structured disbursement of grant funds aligned
        with the two stages of the program. The disbursement is structured to
        encourage and support the studio’s continuous engagement and progress
        through the stages of the program. Here’s how the funding disbursement
        works:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 1: Initial funding</strong><br />
        Upon executing this agreement, the studio will receive a grant of $5,000
        CAD.<br />
        This initial fund aims to support early-stage studio development and
        engagement in the program activities as outlined in the agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stage 2: Continuation funding</strong><br />
        An additional grant of $20,000 CAD will be disbursed to the studio as it
        progresses into the second stage of the program (Months 3-6), provided
        the studio continues to actively engage and fulfill its obligations as
        per this agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disbursement of this fund is contingent on the mutual agreement
        between the studio, Gamma Space, and Baby Ghosts to continue with the
        program based on the self-assessment at the end of Stage 1.
      </p>
      <h3 id="funding-security-and-obligations">
        Funding security and obligations
      </h3>
      <p>
        If the studio opts out of the program at the two-month mark, or if
        either Gamma Space or Baby Ghosts determines that the studio has not met
        its obligations under this agreement, the $20,000 CAD continuation
        funding will not be disbursed. However, the initial $5,000 CAD remains a
        grant and is not repayable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should the team exit or the agreement be terminated after the
        disbursement of the $20,000 CAD, this amount remains a grant and is not
        repayable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This staged funding disbursement model is designed to create a
        supportive and accountable environment, ensuring that the studios are
        fully engaged and are progressively achieving their goals through the
        different stages of the program. By adhering to the terms of this
        agreement, the studio acknowledges the structured funding model and
        commits to actively participating in the program to ensure they achieve
        their studio development goals.
