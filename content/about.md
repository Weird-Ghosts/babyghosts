Co-founders Eileen Mary Holowka and Jennie Robinson Faber bring together their many years of experience in the Canadian video game industry, community arts, and nonprofit management to create a new model for equitable game funding in Canada.

Our programs are made possible due to the generous support of our major donor, Infinite Ammo.
