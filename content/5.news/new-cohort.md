We're excited to announce that, thanks to funding from Clever Endeavour and Weird Ghosts/Infinite Ammo, we were able to accept 7 studios to our new grant and accelerator cohort. 

This cohort was chosen – out of a total of 40 incredible applications! – because of the studios' commitment to cooperative and sustainable working models, community organizing, and social impact. That decision-making process wasn't easy, and we weighed many different factors, including need, experience, willingness, and compatibility with the rest of the cohort. We think this will be a great 6-month program.

Let's meet the cohort:

**Amelore** is an Ontario-based, fully remote cooperative that hopes to make life just a little bit better through the art they create. They are working on *Slappyball* and a secret prototype project.

**Cooped Up** is a Montreal- based

**Cozy Comet** is an Edmonton-based team that exists to provide good lives for their team and create games that positively impact our society and our planet. 

**Diaspora Games** is a Mississauga-based game development studio committed to delivering quality immersive and narrative experiences that recognize and celebrate diverse audiences.

**Ghoul School** is a Toronto-based narrative-driven games co-op interested in telling kind stories in unkind worlds.

**Joel Jordan and Hang Wu** are a Montreal-based collective making experimental, political games for social impact.

**Sweet Baby** is a Montreal-based self-funded narrative development and consultation studio aiming to make video games more compelling, innovative and diverse. Sweet Baby prides itself on helping marginalized talent break into the industry, dedicating time and resources to the next generation of narrative developers, all while building better, more enriching stories.


We love the range of studios in this year's cohort. Some are just starting out and want to slow down and think carefully about their studio development early on. Others are more experienced in making games or operating a business but are looking to define their business structure more clearly. We are excited to see how these teams not only benefit from our peer mentorship program but also learn from one another.
